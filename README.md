# Libft

My own realization of some C standard library funcions.

In order to build a project use a Makefile.
* make all  - will build build a project.
* make clean - will delete all objective files.
* make fclean - will delete all objective files and executable file.
* make re - will build the project again.

Output of the compilation is libft.a

Usage: compilation with all scource files and libft.a
